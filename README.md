# Crime Activity Reporting Portal

	Platform through which a person can give tip-off about any suspicious activity/ crime
    to the authorities.

# Description
    There are cases when people have either witnessed a crime, have a suspicion, or are 
    aware that crime is being planned, but hesitant come forward to report. Forcing people 
    to identify themselves as part of providing a tip-off might therefore lead to missing 
    out on a lot of useful information. Crime Activity Reporting Portal will be a platform 
    through which a person can give tip-off about any suspicious activity or crime in a secure
    and completely anonymous manner. The platform will allow people to give out the most 
    useful information in the shortest amount of time.
